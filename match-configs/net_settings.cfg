sv_client_max_interp_ratio "3" // Allow a max client interp ratio of 3
sv_client_min_interp_ratio "1" // Allow a min client interp ratio of 1
sv_client_cmdrate_difference "0" // Force cmdrate 66
sv_client_predict "1" // Force client side prediction
sv_maxrate "0" // Set max acceptable client rate to unlimited since there's no reason to leave this capped
sv_minrate "60000" // Set min acceptable client packet rate to 60000 bytes/sec (most people use between 60k and 200k rate)
sv_maxcmdrate "66" // Set the max value for cl_cmdrate to 66 ticks/sec
sv_mincmdrate "66" // Set the min value for cl_cmdrate to 66 ticks/sec
// Prevent interp exploits by capping updaterate (contingency even though it should be patched)
sv_maxupdaterate "66" // Set max rate of requestable packets from server to client to 66 per sec
sv_minupdaterate "66" // Set the min rate of requestable packets from server to client to 66 per sec
